        <p>
        You can create a Web page on your desktop computer but nobody can see it but
        you.  If your want other people to be able to see your Web pages, you need
        an account on a computer that has a Web server.  Nowadays most people have
        their own computers on their desks, but normally they don't have Web servers
        and anyway you don't want the whole world coming into your desktop computer
        to see your web page because (a) it's not designed for that, and (b) who
        knows what else they might see.  And (c) for security reasons, Web servers
        should be managed by professionals.  Most institutions have big central
        shared computers for this purpose, which usually have
        a <a href="http://kermitproject.org/unix.html">Unix</a>-like operating
        system such as Linux.  You need an account on one of these so you can put
        your web pages there.  If you don't have access to such a computer, you can get
        a low-cost account on a service like <a href="http://panix.com">Panix.com</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
        You can still create Web pages on your own computer and look at them with
        your computer's Web browser, but for other people to see them, you have to
        upload them to the "big" computer that has the Web browser.

        <h3 id="basics">1. Creating a Web Page</h3>

        <p>
        This page was typed by hand.  Anybody can do this, you don't need any
        special "web creation" tools or HTML editors, and the pages you make can be
        viewed from any browser.
        </p>
        <p>
        When you're just learning and want to experiment, you can do everything on
        your PC.  Create a new directory ("folder") for your website, and then put
        the web-page files (HTML plus any pictures) in it.  Use NotePad or other
        plain-text editor (not word processor) on your PC to create your "home page",
        a file named
        <span>index.html</span>, which you can view locally with your Web
        browser.  (You can also use word processors such as Word or WordPad if you
        save in "plain text", "text", "text document", or "text document MS-DOS
        format".)
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="syntax">2. HTML Syntax</h3>

        Web pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).  HTML has three
        special characters:
        <span>&lt;</span>, <span>&amp;</span>, <span>&gt;</span>.
        An HTML command is enclosed in <span>&lt;...&gt;</span>, for example
        <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>, which is a paragraph separator, or <span>&lt;b&gt;</span>
        ("begin bold") and <span>&lt;/b&gt;</span> ("end bold").  So the following
        HTML text:
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                <pre>This sentence contains &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt; text.</pre>
            </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>produces:
        <blockquote>This sentence contains <b>bold</b> text.</blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
        A Web page starts with a series of HTML commands, and ends with
        a few more.  The contents go in between:
        </p>

        <p>
            <blockquote>
                <pre>
                &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
                &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
                &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Sample Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;/head&gt;
                &lt;body&gt;
                </pre>
            <p>
                <i>(Contents go here)</i>
            </p>
                <pre>
                &lt;/body&gt;
                &lt;/html&gt;
                </pre>
            </blockquote>
        </p>

        <p>
        The first line (<span>DOCTYPE</span>) specifies which markup
        language the page uses
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> = Hypertext Markup
        Language); just copy this line.  The next
        line, <span>&lt;html&gt;</span>, starts the page, and is matched
        by the last line, <span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>, which closes the
        page.  <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>, starts the heading, which
        contains a title to be displayed on the browser's title bar.
        <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span> closes the heading.
        </p>

        <p>
        The <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> tag starts the body of the
        document, is closed by <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span> tag.
        </p>

        <p>As you can see, most HTML commands come in begin-end pairs:
        <span>&lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;</span>,
        <span>&lt;head&gt;...&lt;/head&gt;</span>, etc.  The closing part of the command
        has a slash (<span>/</span>) between the <span>&lt;</span> and the first letter of
        the command.
        </p>

        <p>Blank lines and line breaks are ignored.  The browser automatically "flows"
        your text into lines and paragraphs that fit in its window.  Paragraphs must
        be separated by <span>&lt;p&gt;</span>.  Line breaks can be forced by
        <span>&lt;br&gt;</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
        The next sections tell how to achieve different kinds of effects.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h3 id="chars">3. Special Characters</h3>
        HTML special "character entities" start with ampersand (<span>&amp;</span>) and
        end with semicolon (<span>;</span>), like "<span>&amp;euro;</span>" = "&euro;".  The
        ever-popular "no-break space" is <span>&amp;nbsp;</span>.  There are special
        entity names for accented Latin letters and other West European special
        characters such as:
        <p>
        <blockquote>
            <table border>
                <tr>
                    <td><span>&amp;auml;</span>
                    <td>a-umlaut
                    <td>&nbsp;&auml;&nbsp;
                </tr>
                <tr>

                <tr>

                    <td>a-grave
                    <td>&nbsp;&agrave;&nbsp;
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span>&amp;ntilde;</span>
                    <td>n-tilde
                    <td>&nbsp;&ntilde;&nbsp;
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>German double-s
                    <td>&nbsp;&szlig;&nbsp;
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><span>&amp;thorn;</span>
                    <td>Icelandic thorn
                    <td>&nbsp;&thorn;&nbsp;
                </tr>
            </table>
        </blockquote>
        </p>
        <p>
        Examples:

        <dl>
            <dt>For <b>Spanish</b> you would need:</dt>
            <dd>
                <span>&amp;Aacute;</span> (&Aacute;),
                <span>&amp;aacute;</span> (&aacute;),

            for a complete list.  When the page encoding is
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>, which is
            recommended, you can also enter any character at all, Roman,
            Cyrillic, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek. Japanese,
            etc, either as numeric entities or (if you have a way to type them) directly
            from the keyboard.
        <p>

        And remember: if you want to
        include <span>&lt;</span>, <span>&amp;</span>,
        or <span>&gt;</span> literally in text to be displayed, you have
        to write <span>&amp;lt;</span>,
        <span>&amp;amp;</span>, <span>&amp;gt;</span>, respectively.

        <h3 id="convert">4. Converting Plain Text to HTML</h3>

        <p>
        If you have a plain text file that you want to convert to HTML, load the
        file into a plain-text editor and then follow these steps.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Change all occurrences of "<span>&amp;</span>" to "<span>&amp;amp;</span>".
            <li>Change all occurrences of "<span>&lt;</span>" to "<span>&amp;lt;</span>".
            <li>Change all occurrences of "<span>&gt;</span>" to "<span>&amp;gt;</span>".
            <li>Change any accented letters to HTML entity names (previous section).
            <li>Put "<span>&lt;p&gt;</span>" between each paragraph.
            <li>Insert the standard prolog at the top, substituting an appropriate title.
            <li>Insert the standard epilog at the bottom.
            <li>Save the result as <span><i>xxx</i>.html</span>, where
            <span><i>xxx</i></span> is the part of the original file's name before the dot.
            For example, if the original file was <span>letter.txt</span>, save the edited
            version as <span>letter.html</span>.
        </ol>

        The rest of this document shows some of what you can do with simple HTML
        commands, but I don't explain how to do it.  To see that, just tell your
        browser to <b>View Source</b> and compare the HTML in the source window with
        the result in the original window.

        <blockquote>

            <i>Note:</i> In this and the following
            sections, I use some "deprecated" features from earlier HTML versions
            because they are easier for beginners to learn (for
            example <span>&lt;big&gt;...&lt;/big&gt;</span> versus
            <span style="white-space:pre">

        <blockquote>
            This is a "blockquote", which is like a regular paragraph, but it has bigger
            margins.  Begin a blockquote with <span>&lt;blockquote&gt;</span> and end
            it with <span>&lt;/blockquote&gt;</span>.  Environments such as blockquotes,
            lists, etc, that have a beginning and an end always use paired commands like

        <h3 id="lists">6. Lists</h3>

        Here is an Unordered (bullet) List (<span>&lt;ul&gt;..&lt;ul&gt;</span>):

        <ul>
            <li>This is a List Item (<span>&lt;li&gt;</span>).
            <li>This is another item.
            <li>This is yet another item.
        </ul>

        Here is an Ordered (numbered) List (<span>&lt;ol&gt;..&lt;ol&gt;</span>):

        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>This is a List Item (<span>&lt;li&gt;</span>).
            <li>This is another item.
            <li>This is yet another item.
        </ol>
        <p>


        You can have lists within lists:

        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>A gromet
            <li>A widget
            <li>A framus, which consists of the following components:
            <ul>
                <li>A doohickey.
                <li>A veeblefetzer -- these come in several colors:
                <ol>
                    <li>Purple
                    <li>Purple
                    <li>Purple
                </ol>
                <li>A whatchamacallit.
            </ul>
            <li>A doodad.
        </ol>

        <p>
        And you can have ordered lists that use letters instead of numbers:
        </p>

        <ol type="a">
            <li>Pennies
            <li>Nickels

        <h3 id="links">7. Links</h3>

        <p>
        Links can be internal within a Web page (like to
        the <a href="#contents">Table of Contents</a> at the top), or they
        can be to external web pages or pictures on the same website, or they
        can be to websites, pages, or pictures anywhere else in the world.
        </p>

        <p>

        Here is a link to the <a href="http://www.kermitproject.org/">Kermit
        Project home page</a>.  And here is what the HTML looks like:

            <pre>&lt;a href="http://www.kermitproject.org/"&gt;Kermit Project home page&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        The part inside the quotes is called the URL (Uniform Resource Locator).

        Same table again but with borders:

        </p>
        <blockquote>

            <table border>
                <tr>            <!-- start table row -->

        <p>
        The appearance with double borders is the default (and therefore easiest)
        table style.  You can
        use <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp">table
        attributes</a> to change the appearance.

        <p>

        Here's the same table again but with Column C right-adjusted:

        <p>
        <blockquote>

            <table border>
            <tr>            <!-- start table row -->
                <th>Heading A   <!-- table heading -->
                <th>Heading B
                <th>Heading C
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cell 1A
                <td>Cell 1B
                <td align="right">Cell 1C
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cell 2A
                <td>Cell 2B
                <td align="right">Cell 2C
            <tr>
                <td>Cell 3A
                <td>Cell 3B
                <td align="right">Cell 3C

        <hr>

        <h3 id="viewing">9. Viewing Your Web Page</h3>

        Simple: Open the folder where your Web page is, find the index.html
        file, and double-click on it.

        <p>

        By the way, a web page can have any name at all, it doesn't have to be
        index.html.  Index.html is a special name that is used for the "home page"
        of a website.

        <p>
